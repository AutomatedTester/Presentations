# Stop treating testers as failed developers when developers are failed testers

When I was in university I never once thought that I would get involved in software testing. I actually had no idea that there was a group within software development that just tested software and help developers make high quality applications. Why? Well, the main reason is my university, like most universities, put very little value on teaching people how to test their applications or that they could have a career in software development. Also I am old enough that test automation was only really available if you spent a small fortune on commercial products.

How did I test applications in university? I used to do basic testing of my app to make sure that it worked properly. I call it testing but it was more of a token effort to check things work properly. If my current self saw what my past self was doing there would be words. Harsh ones!

Then I managed to get my first job. Having been bored with my degree and software development I just applied for anything that was somewhat related to my degree. I managed to get a job in a bank as a process engineer. I had to take current processes and try make them better and leaner. This meant that I could learn new things to do with development because, as most of us know, university gives you a grounding, it rarely teaches you how to do the job. I learned about using commercial automation tools and did a lot of development with them and got to figure out problems passing them onto development teams to fix. I was young and found that fun! The thing that I did find annoying was how much effort went into doing a release of the software. We released 3 times a year, unless it was a report that some admin team needed, and then it would go live on a Wednesday evening because, well, it is super high risk to release a report into the system you know!

The testing process was tiresome, cumbersome and took forever! I managed a couple of these global releases from the business end. I had to make sure that the admin teams could still do their processes, even updated, and still get the end result. This was a true exercise in cat herding! After a while the Test Managers asked if I wanted to come work with them and I always said never! Well I was diplomatic about it. Clicking random buttons looked like as much fun as putting pencils in boxes one at a time. The testers that were hired tended to come from the local university or from the admin teams. To me at the time, and maybe this is my pride talking, meant that anyone could do the job no matter how much or what you studied.

The thing that I always seen as silly was that people were trusted with doing a fairly important task, since bugs in banking systems can literally cost millions, weren't anywhere near the development team nor were they paid the same as the developers. Granted they were only clicking buttons and just putting a handful of permutations of test cases through to check the software was working but after seeing what the developers, or Analyst Programmers as they were called, put a token amount of testing in. Since this was my first job out of university I just assumed that it was fine. Hey, I did the same in university and people in the know were doing it too so it couldn't be too bad even if I thought it was silly!

I did try to change my work place but failed horribly and processes stayed the same. So I changed my work place and got work in a small startup. They had 4 engineers and I was going to be starting their testing processes. I was offered the job and I won't lie, I would have taken the job for less than I was offered since my manager, the Technical Director had an amazing reputation for the companies he had created.

My task was "Help increase the quality of the application". I was given the spreadsheets, yes spreadsheets, to look at the application. Since I had been writing automation with WinRunner, yup have a certificate in WinRunner too, I knew there had to be a much better way to do things than go through these spreadsheets and since we were small we couldn't afford to pay for WinRunner. To be honest I am surprised that anyone can after seeing the prices. I then got started on automating the backend via SOAP. Remember when SOAP was cool? Neither do I but I still had to code against it!

I wrote a fairly complex set of tests that anyone could run there tests against their environment and wow... the bugs... But because I wrote things in an extensible way the team, well most of them, were great at adding more tests. I was always treated as one of the developers since, even though I was testing, I was writing code. There was a certain amount of manual testing that I had to do but that never bothered me, especially since I was breaking the site left, right and centre and the developers loved it. 

I was a developer in test and loved my job! And then I went to my first testing conference. There were around 200 people there from lots of different companies talking about different methodologies, things I never heard of and I was supposed to be one of them. I had total impostor syndrome at this event and for the most part, it hasn't got much better since then but I digress.

And then I heard a phrase that hit me in the chest. It winded me...

"I enjoy being a tester because I failed as a developer"

So defeatist...
But words can change the way we think, even if we don't agree with them. Was I a failed developer? Was I in my position because I couldn't code or because I was a new breed of developers that was forming? I was modelling the way we did test development and software development on how large software companies were doing things and they seemed to have their problems but things worked. 

I carried on working doing the right things at the right times solving big and small problems. I would spend most of my evenings hacking on open source projects in a desperate way to prove that I am not a failed developer. Got involved with a little known browser automation project called Selenium which you may have heard of. I was easily able to prove that I was in fact not a failed developer.

During this journey being the "tester" I then started to see how   I was doing things wrong. And by wrong I mean I was doing it so wrong that I started feel bad about my skills. I am a tester who can develop code but the quality of my code needed a levelling up and it required a levelling up in a big way.

But how did we get there? What are the words that could have caused people to think like this?

Doing research into this, and I use the word research quite loosely here since its just speaking to people with in Mozilla I wanted to see if anyone else had seen this situation. I asked testers and I asked engineers if they had seen these situations. Everyone had seen this in one form or another but the best story came from someone in my team who used to be an intern. In his first year he was given an internship in testing. During his first project the phrase that stuck out the most for him was when a manager "You QA people need to fix this issue". 

"YOU QA PEOPLE"

This was then reinforced by his university where QA internships where given to people who never applied early enough for internships or if internships fell through.



Well it was something that most developers I knew didn't do. It is something that most developers don't do. Actually when I was asked to submit a talk I asked a few people at Mozilla what should I talk about and this was one of the main things that came up. From the developers to the testers they all wanted to solve the problem of testing in the python community.
Learning to do test driven development was my next big task that I needed, and more importantly, wanted to learn! Why would I want to do this thing? 

What happened to create this interesting social hierarchy with in development and engineering functions. Is it a natural thing that happens when people get together? Do we do it to protect ourselves from something that we don't know. Let's try get some more data points because we all love metrics. If you don't you should!

I then went to another conference, this one was more developer focused and was shocked by some of the things that I heard. This time it was against other skills that in our field.

The gist them were "Designers are failed artists", "Netops are failed sysadmins" or vice versa.

So why are we doing these things? Why are 	constantly putting a bad face on people who work in different areas? Why are we looking down on others especially in those situations where we don't tend to work. Niches are what make us what we areâ€¦ Niches are what make certain people very good at certain tasks and others not so good. Nurturing these niches is what creates a community and community is what we need. 

We see this with the tech evangelists in the crowd, I know that their task is to try help grow parts of their community and to include more and more people. We see this with my employer too! We need people of different skill sets to be able to make great products!
