							Once upon a time, in a galaxy right here, about 10 years ago we all know
							that WebDriver was created.

							When it was created the internet was a much simpler place. HTML syntax
							was simple and building web pages wasn’t that difficult. You knew that
							if you wanted to do something fancy like animations you will have do some
							amazing JavaScript, and know that it wouldn’t work in all browsers because
							standards were more like guidelines than… standards I guess.

						<h1>How do browsers render web pages</h1>

								good to get a better understanding of how web sites are rendered in a browser.

							MAGIC!

							No?

					<section>
						<h2>Ok... Not Really but it can feel like that.</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Ok... Web pages do not get rendered by magic on the page. They go through a complex set of steps
							before we see the page.

							When you navigate to a web page the first that happens, well after all of the networking and SSL
							work is done, is the html parser. Since most html out there has something that makes it invalid,
							from the wrong headers to missing tags.

							<h2>Let's build a DOM tree</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								This allows the browsers to start building up a DOM tree. For those who don’t know what a DOM Tree
								is, it is a tree-like representation of elements from the page. In Web Driver terms, when you do
								`driver.find_element(“id”, “foo”)` what is returned is a DOM element.

						<h1>Display List needs generating</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							A display list is a sequence of graphics commands that can be used
							to render the page to the screen or other output devices. The information
							used to create the display list is based off various CSS Standards.

							When it starts working browsers will do either top-down traversals
							(pre-ordering) or bottom-up traversals (post-ordering). The browser
							will probably do a few traversals to get the display list. This is
							because there are there are different things that need to get applied
							 at different times. Browsers try do this super fast because there is
							 a perceived speed of the browser in how quickly  a page renders.

						<h1>Things that browsers don't do when building display lists</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							When all the up and down and round about is completed then we have a display list and it looks
							like the snippet about. It says what is a text node, what is a div, what colour it is.

							The browser then tries to apply some optimizations that would prevent
							the graphics code from doing over draws. Over draws is where it would
							draw something in some pixel and then draw over it with an element that
							is in a z-index that puts it higher or more “visible”.

						<h1>So... What does Selenium do?</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Well... a group of engineers tried to reverse engineer what a display might do but...
							remember how I said that things were thrown over the wall when rendering is called?
							Edges cases were there but it was somethig that we could deal with. To be honest
							covering the 80% case would be great and good enough

							element.is_displayed()

						<aside class="notes">
							So… when WebDriver tried to work out whether an element was “visible”
							or not it would do some checks and based on some heuristics on how
							things are rendered it would give you an answer. Web Pages, as I mentioned
							before, were simpler in their structure so WebDriver would do the following:


						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Get a list of all elements between the element being tested for
								  visibility and the document root along a branch of the tree.
							<li>Loop through the list, if not visible return false
								<ul>
									<li>checking if the element is displayed or if they visible.
									<li>Work through elements that might have an opacity of 0 since thats not visible
								</ul>
						</ul>

						<h1>Easy... right?</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							So… this looks simple, it looks at a few basic items and gives you an answer.
							Unfortunately… webpages aren’t that basic. Web Pages are not just items in their
							own branches and then there are times where people do things in weird ways to
							get around browser bugs.

							For the most part the Selenium project had CSS 2.1 support nailed.

						<h1>CSS WG didnt stop working...</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							While we have been waiting to see what other issues could come up and the edge cases
							that we missed the CSS WG were working to make the web platform more efficient with
							it’s rendering and layout of elements on the page.

							Well it was until you could start doing animations in CSS.

							Those sons... and daughters... of probably really nice people refused
							to rest on their laurels, they continued to make things better...
							Dammit!

							Stop making the web platform more efficient and faster... stop making
							hard things for developers easy... STOP!

							Stop breaking our hacky way of working out visibility browser companies
							with your need to make things easier and more efficient!

							Luckily… well some might say it’s lucky… Web Developers can be a little
							slow to add these new features to their sites.

						<h1>"Edge cases, it's all bloody edge cases"</h1>
						<h2>Daniel Wagner-Hall, Initial ChromeDriver Creator</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							When Daniel was doing his internship at Google, he was creating the first
							chromedriver. One day, while Daniel was working on the implementation,
							he slams his hands on the desk and yells, "Edge cases, it's all bloody edge cases".

							And with visibility, it's all bloody edge cases. Horrific edge cases where our view of
							how the browser is rendering things is changing... details of the display list are no longer
							valid from our previous thoughts... we are living in a world where everything is a horrific
							edge case.

							So... what about the edge cases...
							Well it was until Mozilla decided to make a mobile operating system and that,
							my friends, is where things started going horribly wrong!

							Mozilla wanted to create an OS that used web technologies so that people
							already had their apps, they were called web pages! Mozilla invested in making
							Gecko more efficient. They started being clever and millennial, using all the
							new shiny technologies… Open Source Hipsters… using new technologies making the
							web better… making WebDriver’s life incredibly harder.

							So… David, Can we see an example?

							Of course!
						</aside>

					<section>
						<img src="images/css_transform_to_nowhere.jpeg" alt="Element transformed off the page" />
						<aside class="notes">
							So here we have an example of an element that displaying way off on the side there, now
							if I were to interact with it with Selenium, with either sendKeys or click, we would be scrolled to it.
							but... the bloody thing is not scrollable.

							Now... when transforms first came to the web... they were totally not giving the
							right answer... Drivers would say that was visible... something off the screen
							that couldnt be scrolled too... A False Positive... dammit...

							Why is this a false positive? When we did our algorithm, we were looking for specific
							traits of elements. These are different types css properties that we were looking for, like position,
							but not for transforms in this case.

							So when we started walking the tree, and the visibility checking code would do a lot of walking of
							the tree (as an aside this is not the most efficient code) doing checks about position but...
							not in the way that we can think of. It was checking, can we scroll to it and then didnt check we
							had scrolled... then checked for a position css property and then the usual visibility properties.
